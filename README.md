In this project I will create a copy of Google homepage. Doing so will teach me the basics of HTML and CSS, as well as using Github and Git.

This is a part of The Odin Project curriculum (http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).

At first I didn't believe that I can accomplish this, there was too much to do and I had little to no knowledge. Element after element, I managed to finish this project. What I learned from it:

-using the <div> tags;
-using various tags that allign the document - <head>, <center>, <footer>, <body>;
-aligning objects around the page using <placement> tag.
-difference between margin and padding.
-power of "inspect element" tool.
-that no matter the task, if I deconstruct it into smaller chunks, I will be able to accomplish it.
-linking the CSS file.
